## Q1. Git/GitHub

**No handwritten homework reports are accepted for this course.** We work with Git and GitHub. Efficient and abundant use of Git, e.g., frequent and well-documented commits, is an important criterion for grading your homework.

1. Apply for the [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) at GitHub using your UCLA email. You'll get GitHub Pro account for free (unlimited public and private repositories).

2. Create a **private** repository `biostat-203b-2025-winter` and add `Hua-Zhou` and TA team (`Tomoki-Okuno` for Lec 1; `parsajamshidian` and `BowenZhang2001` for Lec 82) as your collaborators with write permission.

3. Top directories of the repository should be `hw1`, `hw2`, ... Maintain two branches `main` and `develop`. The `develop` branch will be your main playground, the place where you develop solution (code) to homework problems and write up report. The `main` branch will be your presentation area. Submit your homework files (Quarto file `qmd`, `html` file converted by Quarto, all code and extra data sets to reproduce results) in the `main` branch.

4. After each homework due date, course reader and instructor will check out your `main` branch for grading. Tag each of your homework submissions with tag names `hw1`, `hw2`, ... Tagging time will be used as your submission time. That means if you tag your `hw1` submission after deadline, penalty points will be deducted for late submission.

5. After this course, you can make this repository public and use it to demonstrate your skill sets on job market.

**Solution** Done.

Q2. Data ethics training
This exercise (and later in this course) uses the MIMIC-IV data v3.1, a freely accessible critical care database developed by the MIT Lab for Computational Physiology. Follow the instructions at https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/gettingstarted/ to (1) complete the CITI Data or Specimens Only Research course and (2) obtain the PhysioNet credential for using the MIMIC-IV data. Display the verification links to your completion report and completion certificate here. You must complete Q2 before working on the remaining questions. (Hint: The CITI training takes a few hours and the PhysioNet credentialing takes a couple days; do not leave it to the last minute.)

**Solution**Here is the [Completion Report](https://www.citiprogram.org/verify/?ke969a4f4-b4ad-4066-bb3f-8febb17a314d-67306596) and my [Completion Certificate](https://www.citiprogram.org/verify/?w1ebe72ea-777e-4eee-8de7-0e0dd1c611a3-67306596) of my CITI Training.
